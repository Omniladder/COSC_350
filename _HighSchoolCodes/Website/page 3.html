<p>Origins:</p>
<p>Tim Drake went the circus as a toddler where the star of it was The Flying Graysons who Dick Grayson the first robin was part of. Tim’s brother then got a photo with them and Dick gave Tim special attention and during that show he witness the death of the Grayson’s. Years later he saw film of Batman and Robin apprehending The Penguin saw robin do a quadruple somersault which was a move only performed by the flying graysons which he used that to backtrack to Bruce Wayne as Batman. After Jason’s death Tim realised a much more violent behavior in batman and saw that batman needs robin for his sanity and so he got help from dick and convinced him batman needs robin but dick helped as nightwing and tim thought he needs robin more. Tim then realised he had to dawn the Robin suit. He later became Red Robin.</p>
