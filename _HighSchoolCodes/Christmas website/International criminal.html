<br>
<b>Billions of Cases of Theft</b>
</center>
<p> 31% out of all people in the world are chtristians now correlate with the fact that there 1.4 billion houses we can estimate that there are about 434 million christian house holds meaning every year santa breaks enters steals cookies from 434 million times in a single day in american law this would be greater then 1 year of jail time so this means that santa should be arrested for around 434 million years for one day of his crime spree now combine this with how hes been doing this tradition since 4th century hess dont this for 1700 years he deserves 737 billion 800 million years of jail time to serve his sentence which sounds like alot but there is proof he is immortal so this isnt to dramatic of a sentence and this is under american law which is very fair and compared to alot of countries he steals from.</p>
