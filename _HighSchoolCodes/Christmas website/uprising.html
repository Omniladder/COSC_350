<b><i>No Military</i></b>
</center>
<p>Military Efforts Wouldn't be helpful due to the fact that The North Pole is one of the only countries that spends some of there Budget on Magic and of course meaning they have more development in magic too and I dont believe all countries cobined could stand a chance and also we dont know the location of his empire

<b> The American Way </b>
<p>First we have to find santa whcih means we have to understand magic to uncloak his empire and to do that we need to the only good magic users left wizards. So first we have to find the wizards and have them train our troops the way of magic and then use our magical agilities to migcally hack the magic cloaking devices and uncloak the north pole then find it and use our now militristic surperiorty to take the north pole and free the elves.

<br>
<b>Protesting</b>
<br>
<p> for this we have to find the north pole still and the protest outside thou this stargety rarely works against sinister evil Tyranncial Dictators as shown in past so this may not work</p>
<br>
<b>Spark The Elf Revolution</b>
<p>For this again we have to find the north pole and spread propaganda showing how great the rest of world is and hope that this sparks a revolution in thwe elf community over santa thou like france and usa in 1700's they need military backing expecially since they never seen war</p>
