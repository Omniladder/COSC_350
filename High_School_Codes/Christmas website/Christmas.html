<p>Elves first ever refereance is all german and combine that with that they were likely from Germany before going to the north pole now you may be questioning then why arent they in Germany and they must have immigrated there as the human world hadn't discorvered north pole until 1909. now what connection does this have to santa's tyrannical behaiour's is definetly provable since santa was first coming until power back around same time as anglo saxxon woden was popularity where his name was sinterklaas which means that year 600 meaning that the how could he have known about the existance of the north pole and the only possible answer is elf interrogation and beyond that he must've then taken over the elf kingdoms.

<p>Now if you look at alot of the production of santa's workshop and toys it is easily comparable to the industrial revolution which happened to also be the time that slavery was the largest and we have never seen  any revolution or progression of slavery being removed from the north pole. and for the second part have you ever seen a fat elf your answer is probably no except unless you watched the documentary on the northpole santa claus 1,2, and 3 with the elf curtis who you reember was in a very powerful posistion same as santa there monarch now combine this with human timeline during the medval/renaissance where fatness was a sign of power because of it's diffculty to obtain</p>
