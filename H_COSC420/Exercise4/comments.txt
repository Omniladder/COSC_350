ompSumA:
    Time: .0006 - .0011
    The Answer is often inaccurate although correct sometimes


ompSumB:
    Time: .0011 - .009
    Generally Slower than SumA
    The Answer is consistently correct

ompSumC:
    Time: Time: .0012 - .009
    Generally Slower than SumA about same as SumB
    The Answer is consistently correct

Summary:
    ompSumA is the fastest, with execution times ranging from 0.0006 to 0.0011 seconds, 
    but its results are sometimes inaccurate. In contrast, ompSumB and ompSumC are slower, 
    with times between 0.0011 and 0.009 seconds and 0.0012 to 0.009 seconds, respectively, 
    but both consistently produce correct answers. While ompSumA prioritizes speed at the 
    cost of occasional inaccuracies, ompSumB and ompSumC trade some speed for reliable accuracy.
